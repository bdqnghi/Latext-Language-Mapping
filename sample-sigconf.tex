\begin{abstract}
Translation from a program written in a language to another is a common software engineering task. The programming languages differs from natural language in many aspects, thus the translation techniques for natural language are not usually applicable for programming language. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel way to add more natural-like semantics feature into programming languages, thus making it feasible to apply the natural language techniques into the programming language translation problem. We adopt Word2Vec, a neural-based technique to learn vector representation of word in natural language, to learn the vector representation for tokens in programming language. We consider the Word2Vec vector space for a pair of programing languages which can be translated from one to another, so called the shared embeddings. From the share embeddings, we can map the similar elements between languages accurately, thus the share embeddings space is served as a foundation for the program translation problem. Our empirical evaluation shows that our model can be used to map elements between languages accurately with high Mean Average Precision score. We also evaluate on a well-known real world task, the clone detection, we achieve a precision 84.2\% and recall 85.23\%.
